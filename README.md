## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Figma File


### What I learned

Furthered my knowledge on Figma. I was more easily able to identify styling within Figma and apply them to my own css stylesheet. I learned to better layout my HTML code and write more semantic HMTL. I used body,main,and article tags to achieve this.


### Continued development

I want to continue playing around with responsiveness. I feel like I don't totally grasp it yet. I know media queries are a tool that can be used to aid this. I'd like to delve deeper into this. Also understanding how to adjust height and widths better.
